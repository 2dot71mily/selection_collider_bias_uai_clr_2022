# Selection Collider Bias in Large Language Models 

Thank you for your interest in our research, originally presented at  [UAI 2022: First Workshop on Causal Representation Learning](https://crl-uai-2022.github.io/).

## Open Source Code
We plan to have our code cleaned up for open sourcing in the next month.


## Open Source Demos
In the meanwhile, please check out our open source demos:
- [Spurious Correlation Evaluation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/emilylearning/spurious_correlation_evaluation), where you can test almost any BERT-like model (hosted on Hugging Face) for selection bias induced spurious correlations for gender, using your choice of input text, `W` variable, x-axis values, and the plotted degree of fit.
- [LLM Uncertainty](https://huggingface.co/spaces/emilylearning/llm_uncertainty), where you can test almost any BERT-like model's prediction uncertainty for gender-identifying predictions from optionally gender-neutral features, using your choice of input text.
